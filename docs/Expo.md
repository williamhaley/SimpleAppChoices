An [expo app](https://expo.io/) is a modern way of using React Native, an advanced programming framework, to write smartphone apps in Javascript and JSX using web technologies. The code can be run on iOS, Android, the web, and can be edited on a website. The apps can be very powerful, but are also fairly complex to write and require a knowledge of React.js

The end result of an expo app is an application that runs on smartphones just like a "native" iOS or Android app.

# Pros

* Complete control of the app experience
* Using industry standards

# Cons / Unknowns

* Would need a crash course in React, web patterns, and using complex software engineering tools
* Complicated process to run and build the app
* A lot more can go wrong with this type of setup, and troubleshooting will be very difficult
* Collaboration may be difficult in a group setting (same sort of concerns as the MIT App Inventor)

# Suggestion

Expo was one of my first knee-jerk suggestions, but with more time to think about it I feel maybe it's not ideal.

The process of getting Expo running will be complex. Although I think the team could learn a lot about app development, I think if we use Expo more time will be spent troubleshooting Expo than will be spent properly designing an idea for the challenge. We'll probably spend the entire 2 months or so just learning Expo, and even then I don't think we'll get very deep into it. I'm only available once a week to help teach it and it's a steep learning curve.

BUT...

I am happy to teach it as best I can. I think we could get something working with Expo and I'm happy to teach it, but I think it may not be an ideal situation for 1) learning something new and 2) completing the challenge.

# Features

Installable on an iPhone or Android device. It's a real app
